# Story master toolkit NIMS (SMTK NIMS) #

### SMTK NIMS - what is it? ###

SMTK NIMS is an LARP handout editor. This is it is main feature and it must do it well. Also it solves more LARP specific tasks.

SMTK NIMS is an interactive web page. You need only modern browser to work with SMTK NIMS. We check it in Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer. SMTK NIMS doesn't require internet connection. It can work in offline mode.

NIMS is a small full stack JavaScript platform so there are some customizations: AWS Shop for Deus Ex Machina LARP and Watches for city LARP. These projects are part of this repo.

### SMTK NIMS work sequence ###

1. Open SMTK NIMS
1. Load your LARP game database for editing
1. Make changes
1. Save LARP game database to your computer

SMTK NIMS can't save LARP game database to file automatically. You need to do it manually. There is always show reminder on closing SMTK NIMS tab in browser.

SMTK NIMS saves changes automatically in web page. For example when make any text changes on very first page it will be saved in page (but not in file).

LARP game database file is just a usual text file in JSON format. If you are interested you can open it in any text editor but be careful. If you broke something then SMTK NIMS will not load it next time.

### Technical details ###

SMTK NIMS implemented in JavaScript with jQuery (datetime calendar), Vis.js (timeline and social networks), Chart.js (donut chart), Docxtemplater (docx export), Mustache (text export), Bootstrap 3 (design elements).
